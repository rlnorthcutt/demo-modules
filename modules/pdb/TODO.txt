pdb:

- Make add js and add css in yaml files work automatically.
  - This is part of a bigger question about where and how roll-ups of assets
    should happen though.
  - Smart bundling handled by Drupal? JSPM? How does it affect our lazyloading
    model in ng2?
- Determine compatibility strategy:
  - By default let as many frameworks as are enabled all be mixed.
  - Have some kind of hook to allow framework modules to declare incompatibility
  - Never allow mixing of incompatible frameworks.
- GraphQL integration --> I don't want this to be mandatory, but an optional
  integration point would be amazing. New
  submodule for this probably.
- ESI integration --> Again, not mandatory, so probably a new submodule.

pdb_ng2:

- Twig integration --> Bug Tobias Bosch about twig outputting ng2 templates work
  that already exists and figure out how that could be integrated into our
  components optionally.

pdb_react:

- Needs a lot of work, I don't know react yet.
